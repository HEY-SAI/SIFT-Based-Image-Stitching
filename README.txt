 INSTRUCTIONS

 - Install MATLAB 2015 or above

 - The code for finding SIFT features is due to Andrea Vedaldi. Go to www.vlfeat.org and
   download the latest version of vlfeat code . Download the binary package. Then
   follow the instructions under Matlab install on the menu on the left. Note that there is a
   lot of documentation for everything, including all functions in VLfeat. You should just
   need to execute the command: run('VLFEATROOT/toolbox/vl_setup')

 - Run the file "mosaic.m", with two of your desired images, on MATLAB to stitch 2 images
 
 - For stitching 'n' images run the file "stitch.m" with your desired images as an image array
